## Overview
Roba-Project is a robot localization simulation project that uses the Particle Filter (Monte Carlo Localization) technique. This project aims to demonstrate robot localization in an environment with obstacles. It utilizes Python with Pygame for visualization.

## Features
- Particle Filter Localization: The project implements the Monte Carlo Localization algorithm for estimating the robot's position probabilistically.
- Robot Control: Users can control the robot's movement using keyboard inputs.
- Obstacle Environment: The simulation environment includes obstacles that the robot must navigate around.
- Real-Time Visualization: Pygame is used for real-time visualization of the robot, particles, and obstacles.

## How to Compile and Run
To compile and run the Roba-Project simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Roba-Project.git

2. Install the required dependencies (Pygame and NumPy):
    pip install pygame numpy 

3. Run the simulation
    python3 main.py
